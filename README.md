# LetterFrequencyAnalysis
Use this to determine the frequency of each letter in a text file passed through the command line.

To use this, make sure freqAnalysis.py is located in the same directory as your text file. Then, run it in command line similar to what you see below.

python freqAnalysis.py file.txt

Where 'file.txt' is your text file.

Enjoy!
